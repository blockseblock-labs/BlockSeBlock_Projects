Create a Motoko actor implementing a fractional reserve mechanism with dynamic supply management. The actor should:
- Track total supply, reserve balance, and reserve ratio
- Allow an admin to set up the contract and assign a price oracle
- Enable the oracle to update the price and trigger supply expansion or contraction
- Implement supply adjustments based on predefined price thresholds (expansion at 1.05, contraction at 0.95)
- Provide methods to query total supply, reserve balance, and current reserve ratio
- Include access control so only admin can set oracle and adjust reserve ratio
- Expand/contract supply by 10% when price thresholds are crossed
- Ensure reserve adjustments maintain a proportional balance
