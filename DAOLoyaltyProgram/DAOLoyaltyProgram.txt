Design a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for a Loyalty Program that allows:  

    - Retailers to propose loyalty reward ideas with a unique ID, description, and retailer identity.  
    - Members to vote on proposed rewards, influencing program benefits and tiers.  
    - Approval of proposals once they meet a predefined vote threshold.  
    - Automated distribution of reward points to members based on participation.  
    - Redemption of reward points for benefits, ensuring members cannot redeem more than their balance.  
    - Querying and tracking of proposals, votes, member rewards, and redemptions for transparency and management.
