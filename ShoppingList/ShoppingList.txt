Build an Motoko application that allows users (principals) create their own private shopping lists.
The shopping lists support adding and removing items, checking and unchecking them, sharing with another user, deleting the list, getting the list, and getting just the unchecked items.
Only the list creator or users the list was shared with should be able to use that list.
