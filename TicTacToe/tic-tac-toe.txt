Create a Motoko actor that functions as a tic-tac-toe dapp. The actor should expose functions for:
- Creating a new game with another player.
- Deleting an existing game with another player.
- Making a move in an existing game.
- Getting the current state of an existing game, also showing the board in a human-readable format.
- Listing all games of the caller.
- Getting the total number of played games.
- Getting game statistics for the caller.

An additional requirement is that the player should be able to play not only
against another player but also against themselves.
