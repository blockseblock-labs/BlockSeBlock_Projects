Develop a Motoko actor to serve as the backend for a batch auction application for a token. 
The actor will manage the following functionalities:

Sale Round configuration
* An auction is defined by a predetermined price range (e.g., $1 to $2) and 
a token sell target (e.g., 1 million tokens).
* An admin sets these parameters before the start of order submission. 

Order Submission
* An admin can open the order submission window. 
* Users can submit order bids consisting of a maximum price (e.g., $1.2) and desired investment amount (e.g., $1000). 
Both values are submitted as decimials. 
* Users can query their bids. 

Closure of Order Book
* An admin can close the order submission window, which immediately triggers the pricing engine and token allocation.

Pricing Engine
* The sale price for each round is determined by a revenue-maximizing
algorithm that performs a parameter sweep from the minimum to the maximum price.
* The algorithm evaluates each scenario price p as follows:
1. Identifying the set of eligible orders with a bid price â‰¥ p.
2. Summing the total funding amount F_p for these orders.
3. Calculating the total token demand D_p by dividing F_p by p.
* The optimal price is determined by identifying the maximum p such that D_p, the total
token demand, is greater than or equal to the specified sell target. 
* In other words, the algorithm selects the highest price at which all tokens, as outlined by the sell target,
can be sold.
* All participants with eligible bids pay the same price.
