Design a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for Eco-Tourism Management that allows:  

    - Tour operators to submit eco-friendly travel proposals with descriptions and estimated carbon offset contributions.  
    - Token holders to vote on proposed trips, ensuring only sustainable offerings get approved.  
    - Automatic approval of proposals that meet the required number of votes.  
    - Tracking of carbon offset contributions to promote environmentally responsible tourism.  
    - Travelers to submit trip reviews, including ratings and feedback on their experiences.  
    - Management of token holders, restricting voting rights to registered participants.  
    - Querying and tracking of proposals, votes, and reviews to maintain transparency.
